#### Overview :
We get two 512 bit primes p and q, and a suspicious hint generated by a recursive function.
#### Solution :
Breaking down the function, we can see that it gives the factorial of a number ***m*** modulo ***n*** .  <br>
The provided hint ***m*** is given such that:
<p align="center">
  <b>
    <i>
                                      (p-1)! = m mod n
  </i>
  </b>
</p>
To make the given hint useful, we can use Wilson's Theorem that states for any prime p, we have the relation:
<p align="center">
  <b>
    <i>
                                      (p-1)! + 1 = 0 mod p
  </i>
  </b>
</p>
This implies that:
<p align="center">
  <b>
    <i>
                                      m + 1 = 0 mod p <br>
                                      m + 1 = k*p
       </i>
          </b>
</p>
Also we have that:
    <p align="center">
  <b>
    <i>
                                      n = p*q
      </i>
     </b>
</p>
So to retrieve the value of p we can calculate the greatest common divisor of both.  <br>
Once we get the value of p, we can calculate q and the rest is just basic RSA.
