### Overview :
We get the modulus ***n*** and the public exponent ***e*** and a list of integers ***out*** generated by encrypting the flag byte by byte.
### Solution :
To retrieve the flag, we need to bruteforce every possible byte and concatenate it with the rest of bytes found. <br>
To calculate the correct byte we need to run through the list and verify for a byte ***b*** and for an element ***j*** in **out** that: <br>
<p align="center">
  <b>
    <i>
                                                b<sup>e</sup> = j mod n
      </i>
  </b>
</p>
We need to do this process for every element in the list and concatenate them together. <br>
That's all you need to know to get the flag, all that is left now is implement this in python. <br>
The final result will look something like the above. <br>
